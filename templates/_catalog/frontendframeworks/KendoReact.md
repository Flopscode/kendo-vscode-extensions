KendoReact is a commercial UI library designed and built for developing business applications with React. Every UI component in the KendoReact suite has been built from the ground-up specifically for React.

All KendoReact components are distributed through npm packages available through npm. Please keep in mind that in order to use the npm packages you should either sign up for a 30-day free trial, or be a licensed developer, as KendoReact has a commercial license. The trial also grants free access to our outstanding technical support.
